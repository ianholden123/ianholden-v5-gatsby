## 📖 Quick start

1. **Install Dependencies**

    Clone this repository and navigate to the directory where it was cloned to.
    
    Install the NPM modules that are required to run this project.
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start developing**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `ianholden-v5-gatsby` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## 🔧 Building for hosting on a custom directory

If you would like to build and host this project on a custom S3 bucket that does not sit at the root of it's domain, you would need to use a `pathPrefix` variable in the `gatsby-config.js` to specify where our resources can be found when we are ready to build the project. To do this, do the following:

1. **Configure path prefix**
    
    Change the `pathPrefix` value in `gatsby-config.js` to match the URL where your Gatsby site will be hosted.

2. **Run build command**

    Run the following in your terminal:
    ```shell
    gatsby build --prefix-paths
    ```

## 🚀 Deploy

### Deploy manually

```bash
gatsby build
```

Once you have run `gatsby build`, upload the generated files from your `/build/` directory to your chosen hosting solution (S3, GCS, private web host, etc...).

### Deploy from CLI

⚠️ You must have [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) installed and you must have a user profile configured in your `~/.aws/credentials` file. This profile requires adequate permissions to upload and delete files from your S3 bucket.

⚠️ The `./scripts/build-and-upload-to-s3.sh` script must have permissions to execute. Change these permissions like so: 

```
chmod +x ./scripts/build-and-upload-to-s3.sh
```


To build the project and upload it to your S3 bucket, run the following command:
```bash
npm run build-and-upload-to-s3
```
