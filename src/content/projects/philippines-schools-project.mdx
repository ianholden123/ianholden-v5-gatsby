This site is a responsive WordPress site, capable of handling a blog, integrating with the charity’s YouTube account and hosting the charity’s annual ‘Story Picture Books’. We allow users to make donations from the site by offering a link to a third-party site that handles donations for us.

When designing the site, we wanted to put a strong emphasis on creating elements that would help increase the number of donations that the website generated. With this goal in mind, the design was influenced by the charity’s pre-existing, vibrant colour palette which we could use to draw attention to donation links and messaging across the site.

    The stark contrast in the charity’s colour palette enabled us to create
    elements of the site that jump out and grab the user’s attention.

The founder of the charity used their previous website to connect with people and inform them of latest news and projects within the charity. Because of this, I wanted to make content a big part of this project. The site needed to handle all of the content that the founder would previously have been able to upload, it should be easy to update and it should be served to users in the most consumable way possible.

    We separated content into different sections of the backend. Here you can
    see that we host Story Picture Books and the blog on entirely separate
    pages.
