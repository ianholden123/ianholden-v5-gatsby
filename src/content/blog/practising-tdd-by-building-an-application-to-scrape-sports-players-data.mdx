Have you ever wanted to gather and expose data via an API or use your gathered data in your own application? For a long while, I have wanted to build my own application that uses web scrapers to do this and I have finally made a start.

With this project, I wanted to make sure that I was practising TDD (Test Driven Development) – something that I would like to practice more often when I am writing code. I needed a simple project to practice with and this one was perfect.

I wanted to scrape data from rugby teams that I follow. Being an avid rugby fan, I figured that this would be the best way to keep me engaged while I was working on the project.

I started by getting a basic example of a scraper working using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) and [Cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio). After doing so, I was able to establish an idea of the type of data that I would be able to capture from my first webpage – Wasps RFC.

Once I loaded the [Wasps rugby team webpage](https://www.wasps.co.uk/players-staff/senior-squad/), I was able to see that I could extract player names, player images, links to player profile pages and player positions. This gave me a good indication of how my player object would look.

Using TDD, your process of writing code should look something like this:

- Write your tests (which will fail because we haven’t written our code yet).
- Write code that will satisfy your tests (all of your tests should pass).
- Refactor this code to make your code cleaner and more efficient (if required).

Using TDD, I outlined the first function that I will need – formPlayerObject. The purpose of this function is to ensure that all players’ data that we collect, is processed and transformed into a consistent data structure that we can apply across other teams and websites that we need to pull data from. This function’s tests looked something like this:

```JavaScript
// index.test.js

describe('formPlayerObject', () => {
  test('supplying zero parameters', () => {
    const expectedResult = {
      team: null,
      name: null,
      position: null,
      playerLink: null,
      image: null
    };

    expect(formPlayerObject()).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({})).toEqual(expectedResult);
  });

  test('supplying incorrect parameters should return null for that field', () => {
    const expectedResult = {
      team: null,
      name: null,
      position: null,
      playerLink: null,
      image: null
    };

    expect(formPlayerObject({ team: {} })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({ name: {} })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({ position: {} })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({ playerLink: {} })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({ image: {} })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    
    expect(formPlayerObject({ team: [] })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({ name: [] })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({ position: [] })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({ playerLink: [] })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({ image: [] })).toEqual(expectedResult);

    expect(formPlayerObject({ team: 0 })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({ name: 0 })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({ position: 0 })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({ playerLink: 0 })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({ image: 0 })).toEqual(expectedResult);

    expect(formPlayerObject({ team: undefined })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({ name: undefined })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({ position: undefined })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({ playerLink: undefined })).toEqual(expectedResult);
    expect(formPlayerObject({ image: undefined })).toEqual(expectedResult);
  });
  
  test('supplying correct object values should return that object\'s value', () => {
    expect(formPlayerObject({ team: 'Wasps' })).toMatchObject({ team: 'Wasps' });
    expect(formPlayerObject({ name: 'Joe Launchbury' })).toMatchObject({ name: 'Joe Launchbury' });
    expect(formPlayerObject({ position: 'Second Row' })).toMatchObject({ position: 'Second Row' });
    expect(formPlayerObject({ playerLink: 'https://...' })).toMatchObject({ playerLink: 'https://...' });
    expect(formPlayerObject({ image: 'https://...' })).toMatchObject({ image: 'https://...' });
  });

  test('supplying unsupported object keys should not return in the object\'s response', () => {
    expect(formPlayerObject({ somethingUnsupported: 'SOME VALUE' })).not.toMatchObject({ somethingUnsupported: 'SOME VALUE' });
  });
})
```

Once I had established what my function should do and how it should respond with different parameters being passed in, I knew that I had created a robust function that was capable of performing the exact purpose that I had intended it to. Using TDD helped me think about some of the edge cases that I might need to cater for which ultimately helped make the function even more robust.

With this test file in place, I then began to write the function like so:

```javascript
// index.js

/**
 * Return a standardised object of a player
 * @param {string} team The team that the player belongs to
 * @param {string} name The name of the player
 * @param {string} position The position that the player plays in
 * @param {string} playerLink The link to the player info page
 * @param {string} image The link to the image of the player
 */
formPlayerObject = ({
  team = null,
  name = null,
  position = null,
  playerLink = null,
  image = null
} = {}) => {
  if (typeof team !== 'string') team = null
  if (typeof name !== 'string') name = null
  if (typeof position !== 'string') position = null
  if (typeof playerLink !== 'string') playerLink = null
  if (typeof image !== 'string') image = null

  return {
    team,
    name,
    position,
    playerLink,
    image
  };
};
```

I continued using this process throughout this project and subsequently, the benefits of this process became more evident as my functions became more complex. I feel that my code benefited by becoming more robust and well-thought-out. As a practice, it is something that I would like to continue.
